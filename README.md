# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to predict student performance based on various academic and demographic factors using Machine Learning techniques. The objective is to analyze patterns in the data and build a predictive model that can assist in early identification of student outcomes.

## 2. Problem Statement
Educational institutions often struggle to identify students who may need additional academic support. This project uses historical data to build a predictive model that estimates student performance based on key attributes.

## 3. Dataset Information
The dataset includes features such as:
- Study time
- Previous grades
- Attendance
- Parental education level
- Other academic and demographic factors

Data preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (if applicable)

## 4. Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (if deployed as web app)

## 5. Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Performance Comparison

## 6. Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression (if classification)

## 7. Model Performance
The best performing model achieved:
- Accuracy: XX%
- R² Score: XX (for regression)
- Confusion Matrix / Evaluation Metrics

## 8. How to Run the Project

### Clone the repository
git clone <your-repository-link>

### Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the application
streamlit run app.py

## 9. Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Deployment on cloud platform
- Adding more features for better prediction accuracy

## 10. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment. It highlights practical implementation skills required for real-world ML applications.
